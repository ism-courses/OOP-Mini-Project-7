The client wants to extend the functionality of a Flight class. The Flight class is defined in this repository.

Here are steps:
1. Create an instance of this class and assign it to an object variable named **my_flight**. The flight should have the flight number “**ISM480**".
2. Call the **add_passenger()** method on this instance to add the passenger “**Bo**" (a string).
3. Call the **add_passenger()** method on this instance again to add the passenger “your_name_here" (a string).
4. Print flight ISM480’s passengers list.

Hint: we cannot use method chaining for this because no return object
